### PCA Algorithm in MATLAB

This repository contains an implementation of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** in MATLAB, applied to 3D data visualization.

### Features
- Centering and standardization of variables  
- Covariance matrix computation  
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors calculation  
- Visualization of principal axes in 3D
  
### How to Run

Open `ACP.m` in MATLAB and run the script.
```matlab
run('ACP.m')
```

### Output

•3D scatter plots (original and normalized data)

•Covariance matrix and eigen decomposition

•Verification of eigenvector orthogonality
